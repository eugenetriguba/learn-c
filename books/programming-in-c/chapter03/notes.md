## Compiling and Running

Compile
$ gcc nameofprogram.c

Run
$ ./a.out
$ Output goes here

Or to use something other than a.out
$ gcc nameofprogram.c -o nameofexecutable
$ ./nameofprogram

## Comments

It is a good idea to get into the habit of
inserting comment statements as the program is being
written. It makes it a far less tedious task to
document while writing the program than afterwards.

It is possible to insert so many comments into a program
that the readability of the program is actually degraded
instead of improved.

It is easier to document the program while the logic
is still fresh in your mind and it helps during the
debugging phase when program logic errors are being
isolated and debugged.
