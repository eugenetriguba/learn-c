# Learn C

This repository is used to house C code that I've written while learning.

All code here is compiled using the following alias:
```sh
alias pcc="gcc -O -Wall -W -pedantic -ansi -std=c99"
```
This ensures the code follows standard C, uses the C99 compiler, 
and outputs extra warning messages from the compiler if it detects 
possible errors.
